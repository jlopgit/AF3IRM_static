               <h4>About Us</h4>
            
               <p>AF3IRM is a national organization of women engaged in transnational feminist, anti-imperialist activism and dedicated to the fight against oppression in all its forms.  AF3IRM’s diverse, multi-ethnic membership is committed to militant movement-building from the United States and effects change through grassroots organizing, trans-ethnic alliance building, education, advocacy and direct action.
               <br>
               <br>
               With the slogan “a woman’s place is at the head of the struggle,” AF3IRM is an all-volunteer, grassroots organization whose members recognize the intersectionality of their struggles and the absolute necessity of women’s revolutionary resistance.
               <br>
               <br>
               AF3IRM has chapters around the country. These include: Boston, Central Coast, DMV (DC/Maryland/Virginia), Hawaii, Los Angeles, New York/New Jersey, Orange County (formerly Irvine), San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Bay – Los Angeles.  Organizing committees are also actively building new chapters in other areas. Interested in building an AF3IRM chapter? Contact chair@af3irm.org for more information.

               <h4>History</h4>
            
               <p>With a history of over 20 years of women’s organizing, activism, and struggle, AF3IRM was launched as a organization in 2010, based on a comprehensive analysis of class, race, gender, and sexuality focused on conducting militant movement-building from the United States with a transnational, feminist perspective. In its previous formation as Gabriela Network (GABNet), we engaged in work from a national democratic perspective, emphasizing support and solidarity for the Philippine movement.  After an assessment of our previous work and continued engagement with the struggles and issues of women and our communities, we have moved toward a comprehensive theory-building and practice based on the concrete conditions of our own home territory, the United States, in assessment of and full knowledge of the essence and specific characteristics of our oppression and exploitation as women; as imported or exploited labor or children/descendants of such; and as women of distinct ethnic and cultural minorities.
